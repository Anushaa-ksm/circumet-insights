ICONS REQUIRED:

You need to add three icon files to this folder:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be simple green/eco-themed icons representing sustainability or recycling.

You can:
1. Create them using any image editor
2. Use an online icon generator
3. Download free icons from sites like flaticon.com or icons8.com

For now, the extension will work but show a generic icon.
To make it look professional, add these PNG files.

Recommended design: A green circular arrow (recycling symbol) or leaf icon.
